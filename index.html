      <p id="about-me">Hi! My name is Michelle and I have been learning to code (on and off) since the end of 2020! This
        is my second
        time rebuilding this exact website because somehow the first one was lost D: I am hoping to make a career out of
        coding and I am hoping that CodeYourFuture could be the next step for me to take in doing so! I look forward to
        what the future holds and I am excited to learn new skills, refresh the old ones, and hopefully get back into
        the
        working world within the tech industry!</p>
